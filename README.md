# SVEIHRM_model

These codes are experimental reproductions of the paper "A model of COVID-19 pandemic with vaccines and mutant viruses" published in PLOS one.

1. The SVEIHRM_codes folder contains code and data files to reproduce the figures from Figures 3 to 15.
We can get the result by opening and running the desired figure file, but our code includes matlab's paid package (optimization tool).

2. The resulting figures from the code are attached to the Figures folder.
These figures are saved as tif files.
